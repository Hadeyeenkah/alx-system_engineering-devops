1. Ever wondered what happens when you type https://www.google.com in your browser and hit Enter? Let's break it down! ðŸ§µðŸ‘‡

2. DNS Request: Your browser checks its cache for the IP address of Google. If not found, it queries DNS servers to translate "google.com" into an IP address.

3. TCP/IP: Once the IP address is known, your browser initiates a TCP connection with Googleâ€™s server, involving a three-step handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK).

4. Firewall: Your request passes through firewalls, which ensure security by filtering out malicious traffic on both client and server sides.

5. HTTPS/SSL: To secure data, HTTPS is used. An SSL handshake occurs, exchanging encryption keys and verifying Googleâ€™s SSL certificate to establish a secure connection.

6. Load Balancer: Google's load balancer distributes your request across multiple servers to manage traffic efficiently and ensure reliability.

7. Web Server: The load balancer directs your request to a web server, which handles HTTP requests and serves static content like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

8. Application Server: For dynamic content, the web server forwards the request to an application server that processes business logic and interacts with databases.

9. Database: The application server queries databases to fetch or store data. SQL or NoSQL databases are used based on the data requirements.

10. Finally, the server sends the response back through the established secure connection, and your browser renders the Google homepage! ðŸŒŸ
